# Guess_Game_project
Guessing game practiced by me in python

Objective: 
The program randomly selects a number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the player has to guess that number.

Gameplay:
The program prompts the player to enter their guess.
After each guess, the program informs the player whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.
The player continues guessing until they guess the correct number.
